# DES-using-CFB
Implementation of DES (CFB mode) using Java

All the three codes are required to be implemented in a single package.
Here three different files with the names 'Message.txt' , 'Alice.txt' and 'Bob.txt' are created in the same folder as of the codes.
The Plain text or message will be saved in the 'Message.txt' file while encryption.
Similarly the cipher text generated will be stored in the 'Alice.txt' file after encryption which can be shared along with the key to the receiver.

The Key should be of length 12 but the last character of the key must be '='. So, I have decided to take only 11 characters as input from the user and concatenate the '=' symbol after getting the input.

For decryption, the receiver will enter the cipher text generated by the sender and the same key used by the sender.
Then the user will get the plaintext message.

Note:
(1) It is advised to verify whether the key is working fine by performing both the processes before sharing the cipher text and the key so as there will not be any error while decrypting on the receiver's side.
(2) In this code the 'IV parameter' has been given a default value but if you are interested in making the code more secure then you may take the input for the 'IV parameter' as well from the user. 

The same project with a GUI will be shared soon in a different repository.

Any queries/doubts regarding the code or implementation?
Feel free to ping me up anytime. I will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
